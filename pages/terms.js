          orally, is designated as proprietary or confidential at the time of

          disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement,
          including Section 4.1 (Use of Input); and (b) only use Confidential
          Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this

          Confidential Information, except, in the case where Aividoo is the
          Recipient, Aividoo may retain the Customer’s Confidential Information
          to the extent required to continue to provide the Services. Recipient
          may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents,
          contractors, and other representatives having a legitimate need to
          know, provided it remains responsible for their compliance with this
          Section 13 and they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less
          protective than this Section 13.

          party; (b) it rightfully knew or possessed prior to receipt under this
          Agreement; (c) it rightfully received from a third party without
          breach of confidentiality obligations; or (d) it independently

          appropriate equitable relief, in addition to other available remedies,
          for breach or threatened breach of this Section 13, without the
          necessity of posting any bond or proving actual damages.

          during the period designated by Aividoo (not to exceed 14 days unless

          This Agreement, including the Privacy Policy and any other agreements
          expressly incorporated by reference into this Agreement, are the
          entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Customer and
          Aividoo regarding your use of the Services. The terms in any Customer
          purchase order, ordering document, or business form will not amend or
          modify this Agreement and are expressly rejected by Aividoo; any of
          these Customer documents are for administrative purposes only and have
          no legal effect. Customer may not assign or transfer this Agreement or
          its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of
          law or otherwise, without Aividoo’s prior written consent. Aividoo may
          assign this Agreement and all rights granted under this Agreement,
          including with respect to your Input, at any time without notice or
          consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not
          affect Aividoo’s right to require performance at any other time after
          that, nor will a waiver by Aividoo of any breach or default of this
          Agreement, or any provision of this Agreement, be a waiver of any
          subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use
          of Section headers in this Agreement is for convenience only and will
          not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Neither
          party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation
          under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay Fees) due to events
          beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, pandemic, epidemic,
          health emergency, blockade, war, pandemic, act of terrorism, riot,
          Internet or utility failures, refusal of government license, or
          natural disaster. Throughout this Agreement the use of the word
          “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of this
          Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the
          unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent
          possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and
          effect. Aividoo may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise
          Aividoo’s rights and to perform Aividoo’s obligations on behalf of

              connection with this Agreement, the Services, or communications

              uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less

              discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by
              courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims
              whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
              misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of
